# tokgan_after_effects_import

Import Tokgan ML shape data directly into Adobe After Effects as native shape
layers, bypassing the Silhouette → Adobe Premiere/AE export round-trip used
by the sibling [tokgan_silhouette_import][sib] tool.

The output is **one** AE shape layer named *Tokgan Shapes* containing one
Vector Group per source object. Each group has:

* a Bezier path animated frame-by-frame,
* a hold-stepped opacity track driven by which source frames the object
  exists in,
* a fill.

Because every group is a true shape-layer path (not a mask), AE's regular
**motion blur switch** produces sub-frame interpolated blur — which was the
original motivation. The layer is created with motion blur already enabled.

## Requirements

* Python 3.8+ (standard library only — no `pip install` step).
* After Effects 2024+ (tested on AE 25.6 / Mac).
* The AE preference **Allow Scripts to Write Files and Access Network**
  must be enabled — `Settings > Scripting & Expressions`. Without it the
  loader cannot read its sidecar JSON.

## Quick start

```bash
# Convert a JSON to an AE loader + sidecar
python3 tokgan_json_to_ae.py data/9961755_uhd_2160x4096_25fps_48frames.json

# This writes two files next to the JSON:
#   data/9961755_uhd_2160x4096_25fps_48frames.jsx
#   data/9961755_uhd_2160x4096_25fps_48frames_data.json
```

Then in After Effects:

1. Open (or create) a composition whose dimensions match the JSON's
   `resolution` field. The loader uses `app.project.activeItem` if it's a
   comp; otherwise it creates a new `TokganShapes` comp.
2. `File > Scripts > Run Script File…` and pick the generated `.jsx`.
3. Wait — large clips can take 20–60 seconds for the path-keyframe writes.
   A progress line goes to the ExtendScript Toolkit console (`$.writeln`)
   when complete:
   ```
   [Tokgan] data fps=24 comp fps=25 scale=0.96
   ```

To replace an existing import without manual cleanup, just re-run the
loader. It removes the previous *Tokgan Shapes* layer before building the
new one.

### Usage

```
$ python3 tokgan_json_to_ae.py --help
usage: tokgan_json_to_ae [-h] [-f] input [output]

Convert a Tokgan JSON shape file into an After Effects loader (.jsx) plus a
compact sidecar data JSON. Run the resulting .jsx in AE via File > Scripts >
Run Script File... to build a single shape layer holding one animated Bezier
path per object.

positional arguments:
  input        Path to input Tokgan JSON file
  output       Path to write the AE loader .jsx (default: same dir/name as
               the input with .jsx extension).

options:
  -h, --help   show this help message and exit
  -f, --force  Rebuild the sidecar data file even if it's newer than the input.
```

## What the loader does, in order

1. Locates its sidecar `_data.json` next to itself via `parent.getFiles()`
   (avoids the ExtendScript File-constructor quirks with `:` and spaces in
   filenames).
2. Reads + parses the sidecar (`JSON.parse`, with `eval("("+raw+")")`
   fallback for ExtendScript builds that lack `JSON`).
3. Uses the active comp, or creates one with the JSON's resolution / fps /
   duration if none is active.
4. Removes any pre-existing *Tokgan Shapes* layer for clean re-runs.
5. For each source object, adds a Vector Group whose Contents holds a Path
   and a Fill. The path bezier is written in one batched
   `setValuesAtTimes(...)` call, with a per-frame fallback. The group's
   `Transform > Opacity` gets hold-stepped 0/100 keys around every visible
   segment.
6. Resets the layer's anchor and position to `(0,0)` so JSON pixel coords
   land at comp pixel coords with no half-resolution offset.
7. Scales every keyframe time by `data.fps / comp.frameRate` so each source
   frame lands on one comp frame regardless of declared fps.
8. Enables `layer.motionBlur` and `comp.motionBlur`.

## Example

`data/9961755_uhd_2160x4096_25fps_48frames.json` is a 23 MB sample from the
`tokgan_silhouette_import` repo — 48 frames at 25 fps, 63 body-part shapes
on a single subject. Run the converter, drop the `.jsx` into AE, and you'll
get a 2160 × 4096 comp populated with motion-blur-ready animated shape
paths.

The source footage for this clip is Pexels video **9961755** (UHD 2160 ×
4096, 25 fps); download from <https://www.pexels.com> and import as an
image sequence or video to match against the imported shapes.

## Sharing with other machines

The `.jsx` is only a loader; the shape data lives in the `_data.json`
sidecar. **Always send both files together** (same folder, original
names). Sending just the `.jsx` gets you a "Locate sidecar" dialog in AE,
and picking the raw Tokgan JSON there will not work. Alternatively, send
only the raw Tokgan JSON and have the recipient run the converter.

Output is identical on Mac, Linux and Windows: the `.jsx` is pure ASCII
with LF line endings, and the sidecar is UTF-8 with LF line endings.

## Compositing

To use the imported shape layer as an animated alpha matte on footage:

1. Drop your footage into the same comp, below the *Tokgan Shapes* layer.
2. On the footage layer, set the **Track Matte** column to *Tokgan Shapes*
   (defaults to Alpha Matte).

Motion blur on the shape layer carries through to the matte edges. For
naturally-centered blur, set the comp's **Shutter Phase** to half the
negative **Shutter Angle** (e.g. `-90°` when shutter is `180°`) under
`Composition Settings > Advanced`.

## AE 25.6 quirks the loader works around

While building this, I tripped on a handful of After Effects 25.6
ExtendScript quirks worth knowing about if you hack on the loader:

* `app.beginSuppressDialogs()` takes **zero** parameters in 25.6 (older
  docs say a boolean). Passing one throws `requires 0 parameters`. The
  loader doesn't call it at all.
* `JSON` is **undefined** in this ExtendScript build. The loader falls
  back to `eval("(" + raw + ")")` for the sidecar.
* AE invalidates earlier `Property` references when **sibling**
  `addProperty` calls mutate the parent group. The loader does all
  `addProperty` calls first, then re-walks `numProperties` to acquire the
  pathItem fresh — otherwise `pathProp.setValueAtTime(…)` throws
  `Object is invalid`.
* AE caches compiled `.jsx` bytecode by path. If you edit a loader and
  AE keeps replaying the old error, quit + relaunch AE or save to a
  fresh filename.
* `addProperty` / `canAddProperty` will hard-crash AE on undocumented
  match names — stick to the documented `ADBE …` strings.
